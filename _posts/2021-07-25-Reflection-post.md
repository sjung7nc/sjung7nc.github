Go back and read your initial blog post where we discussed data science as well as your blog post about your thoughts on R.  Write a reflection post about:

what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do  
what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?  
what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  
Your blog post can be written in a conversational tone or more formally (however you want to represent yourself).  
There is no word count or anything like that, just make sure you answer the prompts above to receive full credit.
