![r and data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58168249/126904572-f0353079-ab49-4895-b701-0aaa45c5e887.png)  

## What has changed about what I think a data scientist is and what they do  
I feel like the data scientists focus more on manipulating data and think how to present the results so people easily understand it. They tend to print out fancy outputs such as good looking data tables or pretty graphs so let people easily read it.  

## What my current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science  
R is very useful for data science. Many people developed their own codes and shared them with others. We can easily find bunch of options and solutions when we get an issue while coding. There are so many options of plots and many other data sources can be used in R.  

## Do I think I'll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not?  
Sure, I will do. As we see in the picture above many of technical skills are expected in data scientists job. Not only R, also SAS and Python and other new programming languages coming popular are on my list. Each program language has their own strong side. Say R, it is a open source so we don't need to pay for it and that's why many people easily can approach it. People develope their own codes or functions and share them with others. R is very useful and it's abilities are almost unlimited.  

## What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
