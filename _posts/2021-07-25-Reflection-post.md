# What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do  

# What my current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science  

# Do I think I'll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not?  
Sure, I will do. As we see in the picture above many of technical skills are expected in data scientists job. Not only R, also SAS and Python and other new programming languages coming popular are on my list. Each program language has their own strong side. Say R, it is a open source so we don't need to pay for it and that's why many people easily can approach it. People develope their own codes or functions and share them with others. R is very useful and it's abilities are almost unlimited.  

# What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
