# R vs SAS  
First of all, *R is an open source* so anyone can access to it easily. In other hand, SAS is pretty expensive. Good thing, SAS offers SAS University Edition for free these days.  
Because R is free, many people use it and share their own created functions. There are so many optoins can solve the problems. 
People can easily get information about R in several ways, such as the Github, the Cran and the stackoverflow.

# What functionality do I like about R?  
We can create our own function and share the function with others.

# What parts do I miss about SAS language?  
SAS has limited functions and syntax. Of course, SAS developers keep creating better functions but that is all.  
We just learn SAS programming laguage upto centain level and then just need to update my knowledge.

# R is a difficult language to learn?
I don't think so. However, there are too many functions and alternative options so I don't think no one can say "I mastered R!!".
