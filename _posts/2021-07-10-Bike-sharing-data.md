• what would you do differently?  

• what was the most difficult part for you?  
Working as a group was not easy. For instance, one time we worked at the same time so when I tried to push my code, the R studio let me pull github before pushing. 
I had to copy and paste my added code in a seperate R script and then pulled the updated code and then added my code back in there and eventually pushed. 
We did talk to each other every day but had to communicate more often to prevent waste time or redundant work.  
However, I liked to work with my partner. I believe we had pretty good team work for this project.

• what are your big take-aways from this project?  
The main take-away from this project for me is that we need to communicate more often when I do team project.  
Other than that I got the concept the whole process to predict values such as how to choose meaningful variables, what and how do we predict values and comparing several methods. 
It was a very good chance to play around the functions and datasets and it ended up to lots of learning.
