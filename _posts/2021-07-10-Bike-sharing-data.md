This *Bike-sharing project* was done by me and my partner as a team. We mostly used the **slack** to communicate or hold a video chat.  
Starting from reading in the bike-sharing dataset, we did summarizing it and analyzed variables what we were interested in. By plotting we could see the relationship between variables and their trends. One of the most interesting results was that the registered users tends to decrease on holidays, while the casual users are increased. I guess that's because people are looking for an unusual thing to do on holidays. After analyzing the data we chose 4 different models of meaningful variables to predict total number of users and then compared their RMSE to figure out which model is the most fit. 


- what would you do differently?  
I am pretty satisfy with the result so nothing would do differently. But if I have to say something then I would like to add more summarization section. I wanted to be fair so stopped adding things but analyzing data was fun to me and good way to see the trends.

- what was the most difficult part for you?  
Working as a group was not easy. For instance, one time we worked at the same time so when I tried to push my code, the R studio let me pull github again before pushing. 
I had to copy and paste my added code in a seperate R script and then pulled the updated code and then added my code back in there and eventually pushed. 
We talked to each other every day but still needed to communicate more often to prevent waste time or redundant work.  
However, I liked to work with my partner and I believe that we had pretty good team work for this project.  

- what are your big take-aways from this project?  
The main take-away from this project for me is that we need to communicate more often when we do team project.  
Other than that I got the concept the whole process to predict values such as how to choose meaningful variables, what and how do we predict values and comparing several methods. 
It was a very good chance to play around the functions and datasets and it ended up to lots of learning.
