*The goal with this project is to create a vignette about functions I’ve created to read in some data from
the National Hockey League’s (NHL) API along with use cases and some exploratory data analysis using the data.*

Recently I've seen sports stats job postings and I was wondering what the sports stats are for. I think that I got a base idea about that from this project. Thanks, Dr.Post!  

I tried to focus on this NHL data to see **which factors are related to Team winning or Goals**.  
First, I picked 2 franchise IDs to comapare with by a new varaible called win_chance created by (wins)/(gamesPlayed). The franchise ID=1 had 51.2% of winning chance and the franchise ID=20 had 41.8% of it so I worked to figure out which factors affected their different results.  
- I am not a sports person so started with a simple easy approach. Whether skater's assists helped team winning or not. Yes, **more assists brought more goals**!  
- Next outputs were interesting. Whether skater's penalty minutes ruined team winning or not. NOPE!! Somehow skater's penalty minutes helped team winning! **They scored more goals as they had more penalty time**. What an interesting result.  
- Is playing at Home really an advantage? I created a new variable called HomeWin.ratio and **every single team had over 50% of winning chance when they played at home**. I wanted to know which factors gave advantage to Home team but I could not find data related to that.  

This project was interesting but not easy to me. Creating functions and analysis data, every single step was a kind of obstacle. I had to fix the functions most of the time. So many missing stuffs popped up so I had to add on things or modified them. The output data didn't fit to the plots what I was about to use. I thought once I create all the functions then next steps would be much easier but it was endless.  

If I get a chance to do similar project next time, I would study more about the subject and the given data first, and then start coding.  

I bet I learnd a lot while doing this project so no complaining allowed! :)
