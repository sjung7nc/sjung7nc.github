*The goal with this project is to create a vignette about functions I’ve created to read in some data from
the National Hockey League’s (NHL) API along with use cases and some exploratory data analysis using the data.*

I did analysis the NHL data to see **which factors are related to Team winning**.  
I am not a sports person so I did an analysis that everyone could think of but got some results that not what I expected.  
The most interesting part was **penalty minutes and goals/wins corelation**! 
If I ask people whether players who had less penalty time scored more goals than players who had more penalty time did 
then most people would answer the player with less penalty time scored more. WRONG!! The data is telling a different story. 
The results from the NHL data tell us the players scored more goals as they had more penalty minutes. What an interesting result!!  

This project was not easy to me. From creating functions to analysis datasets, every single step was a kind of obstacles. 
I thought once I create all the functions what I need then it would be much easier next but I had no idea what to do with whole bunch of datasets I got by the functions. 
In the project there should be at least 5 plots including one bar plot, one histogram, one box plot, and one scatter plot. 
However every time I wanted to create plots only jitter plot fitted my ideas. If I get a chance to do similar project next time, I would study more about the subject and think variery approaches to get variety results.  

– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?
– what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?
