This *Bike-sharing project* was done by me and my partner as a team. We mostly used the **slack** to communicate or hold a video chat.  
Starting from reading in the bike-sharing dataset, we did summarizing it and analyzed variables what we were interested in. By plotting we could see the relationship between variables and their trends. One of the most interesting results was that the registered users tended to decrease on holidays, while the casual users were increased. I guess that's because people were looking for an unusual thing to do on holidays. After analyzing the data, we chose 4 different models of meaningful variables to predict total number of users and then compared their RMSE to figure out which model was the most fit.
