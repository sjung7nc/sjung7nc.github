• what would you do differently?  

• what was the most difficult part for you?  

• what are your big take-aways from this project?  
The main take-away from this project for me is that we need to communicate more often when I do team project. I think the team work with my partner was pretty good though! 
Other than that I got the concept the whole process to predict values such as how to choose meaningful variables, what and how do we predict values and comparing several methods. 
It was a very good chance to play around the functions and datasets and it ended up to lots of learning.
