*The goal with this project is to create a vignette to show how to retrieve data from an API. I’ve created functions to read in some of endpoints from
the National Hockey League’s (NHL) API along with some exploratory data analysis by using the data.*

Recently I've seen sports stats job postings multiple times and I was wondering what they do. I believe that I got a base idea about that from this project.

I tried to focus on this NHL data to see **which factors affect Team winning or Goals**.  
First, I created a new variable named "win_chance" by calculating (wins)/(gamesPlayed). And then, I picked 2 franchise IDs including one witn high winning chance and the other one with low winning chance. I worked to figure out which factors affected their different results.  
- I am not a sports person so started with a simple easy approach. Whether skater's assists helped team winning or not. Yes, **more assists brought more goals**!  
- Next outputs were interesting. Whether skater's penalty minutes ruined team winning or not. NOPE!! Somehow skater's penalty minutes did not affect team winning or losing!   
- Is playing at Home really an advantage? I created a new variable called HomeWin.ratio and **every single team had over 50% of winning chance when they played at home**.
